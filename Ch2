#Chapter 2
Python

Convention = what most programmers do in a certain syntax

Ex: convention in python to name variables is to use all_lowercase_and_separate_w_underscores
convention in JavaScript is to use CapitalAndLowercaseNoSpaces

f strings are the easiest way to insert variables into strings

Spyder does not take strings well
foo = 'tom brady' ----> foo.captalize() ----> Tom brady
foo.capitalize? returns a definition of what the function does

foo, bar, and baz are throwaway variables that have been used since the 50s
