Data analysis derives insights without modeling

1) understand distribution of a single variable
2) Understanding the realtionship between two or more variables
3) Summarize with one composite score <------BIG

Distribution vs Summary Stats pg 149

Data visualization in Python is fragmented
  -i.e. there are multiple ways to do it
  - can get confusing

Matplotlib --> seaborn
  - Seaborn library is built on top of the mathplotlib

# density plot of standard points
g = sns.displot(df, x='std', kind='kde', fill=True)

fill = True is so the graph is shaded

Seaborn slicing and dicing plots is extrmely useful
  - Levers: hue, col, etc.

Scatter plots are good for realtionships between variables
Line plots are better when one variable is time

Seems like the "composite score" thing he was talking about was more about the data we use, which the author does not like
  - he would rather use raw columns of data than a murky stat like QB rating

suptitle means "supertitle"

set method: how much of the x and y axis do you want to show?
