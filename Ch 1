# Spyder
IDE has a console and editor
only issue is Anaconda takes up a ton of disk space

Keyboard shortcuts
use f5 to run the whole code
f9 to run highlighted code

On windows:
Ctrl + shift + e : moves to the editor
Ctrl + shift + i : moves you to the REPL

Downloaded Anki, it doesn't have multiple choice or anything, but could be good in long run

.csv files are kept in , notation with , in between columns of info
