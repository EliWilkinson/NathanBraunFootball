SQL deals with 
2)Storing data
3)Loading data 

in the 5 steps of data analysis

CANNOT use SQL unless you have database to use it ON

Databases are importnt to keep info in so we aren't just keeping everything in a spreadsheet.
	-it gets cluttered very fast in one spreadsheet
	
Don't repeat yourself (DRY) when writing code

SQL is good at joining tables, so even though you can store everything in csv file(s), 
SQL makes relational databases

pg 110
A single = in SQL is different than in Python
= tests for Equality in SQL

Overpriced book on adding cross tables
The Essence of SQL
pg 115 he calls "the essence" of The Essence of SQL

Limit/ Top changes depending on the databse, which is annoying

Union allows you to stack data on top of each other to make one table

Example page 118-120 would be good to look at later
