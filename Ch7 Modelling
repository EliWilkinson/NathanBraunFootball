#'''

Model- details of an output variable and one or one input variables


Simplest model:
	
	touchdown or not = model(yards to endzone)
	
	output variable: touchdown or not
	yards to endzone: input variable

 Linear regression
 	y = mx + b

pg 175
The math of linear regression is beyond the scope of this book :(

R squared is alwya between 0 and 1
	- 0 means your model tells nothing
	- 1 means your model is perfect

P values and the reciplicability crisis
	- is the relationship in your model significant or fabricated?

Regression hold things constant

Quadratic variables are common when you think it depends on hwere you are on the input

Interaction- allows effect of variable to change depending on the value of another variable

Ranodm Forests
	- CARTs Classification and Regression Trees 
	- Branches are "if --> then" statements
	- Widom in crowds approach
	- Random sample of observations (rows) and limitng them to a random subset of columns
	- this makes the trees different and provides the best results overall
	- Default in python makes 100 CART trees, but you can change this parameter
	- susceptible to overfitting
