Model- details of an output variable and one or one input variables


Simplest model:
	
	touchdown or not = model(yards to endzone)
	
	output variable: touchdown or not
	yards to endzone: input variable

 Linear regression
 	y = mx + b

pg 175
The math of linear regression is beyond the scope of this book :(

R squared is alwya between 0 and 1
	- 0 means your model tells nothing
	- 1 means your model is perfect

P values and the reciplicability crisis
	- is the relationship in your model significant or fabricated?

Regression hold things constant

Quadratic variables are common when you think it depends on hwere you are on the input

Interaction- allows effect of variable to change depending on the value of another variable

Ranodm Forests
	- CARTs Classification and Regression Trees 
	- Branches are "if --> then" statements
	- Widom in crowds approach
	- Random sample of observations (rows) and limitng them to a random subset of columns
	- this makes the trees different and provides the best results overall
	- Default in python makes 100 CART trees, but you can change this parameter
	- susceptible to overfitting

Example pg 189

Because Random Forests are so flexible, it's pointless to evaluate them on the same data used to build the model, they perform too well
	- what does this mean? I thought this was a model?
	- instead you should:
	- take a holdout set (where you know the result)
	- in this case position (we know what everyplayer's position is
	- this evaluates the model on data that was NOT used to train it
	- test_size = .20 (means wea re splitting our data 80/20 to build and test our model
	- n_estimators = number of trees we want to run
	- grouping: sees how our model did by position (could be relevent for the different conferences in sports betting?)
	- Cross validation reduces noise (you can get widely fluctuating results if you run Random forests multiple times)

Cross Validation
	- takes multiple holdout sets and blends them together
	- instead of using fit, use the scikit-learn function: cross_val_score

Random Forest Regressions
	- whould you use the RandomForestRegressor or the OLS statsmodels technique?
	- for coefficients and understanding and interpreting your model: lean classic linear regression
	- don't care about understanding how it works as long as it's accurate? : Random Forest
