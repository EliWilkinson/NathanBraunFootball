Pandas

Most information rich chapter in the book 
1) data from csv (comma separated values) file ---> DataFrame
2) access specific columns and rows
3) learn indexes in DataFrames
4) outputting DataFrames as csv files

Had to change variable to file path BEFORE importing os and pandas
  -successfully created a DataFrame

DataFrame.head() shows the first five rows of our data
  - ... shows some columns won't fit on screen
  - very useful as we go

#Working with subsets of DataFrames
  - getting one single column similar to a dicitonary
  - adp['name'].head()
  - technically a Series.. NOT a DataFrame
  -not important now, but will come up later
  -Don't forget:
  adp[['name', 'position', 'adp']].head()
  
  The extra pair of brackets is essential


Page 60/61
  -seems like changing argument to inplace= True to set our left most column would be easier,
  but the alternative would be worth revisiting one day

Main benefit of indexing is keeping things aligned

Lot of tests and boolean stuff so far

Part 2

numPy is a more more raw math oriented pyhton library
