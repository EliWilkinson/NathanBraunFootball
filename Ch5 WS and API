There are two ways to get data:
Web Scraping and APIs

Web scraping deals mostly in HTML CSS and JavaScript

Attributes are optional data
  - common ones are id and class
  - they are modified from a separate CSS file
  - CSS is cosmetic, we don't care what our data looks like, but it's good to know
