There are two ways to get data:
Web Scraping and APIs

Web scraping deals mostly in HTML CSS and JavaScript

Attributes are optional data
  - common ones are id and class
  - they are modified from a separate CSS file
  - CSS is cosmetic, we don't care what our data looks like, but it's good to know

Converting BS4 strings into Python strings is good practice

Scraping:
tr_tag.find_all('th')

Getting the text strings from the scrape
[str(x.string) for x in tr_tag.find_all('th')]
