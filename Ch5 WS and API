There are two ways to get data:
Web Scraping and APIs

Web scraping deals mostly in HTML CSS and JavaScript

Attributes are optional data
  - common ones are id and class
  - they are modified from a separate CSS file
  - CSS is cosmetic, we don't care what our data looks like, but it's good to know

Converting BS4 strings into Python strings is good practice

Scraping:
tr_tag.find_all('th')

Getting the text strings from the scrape
[str(x.string) for x in tr_tag.find_all('th')]

APIs

Application Programming Interface

Difference between API and web API

Some APIs are public, some are private 

pg 139
HTTP is a request to a web server
  -get is a common request for data in public APIs

JSON
  -different data format than HTML
  - JavaScript Object Notation
  - must be parsed to be useful, because it's gibberish for the most part
  - after parsing it's just a bunch of Python lists and dicts

Other than being less code, APIs have other appeals too
  - in the past, HTML and CSS much more popular
  - most data now is loaded in JavaScript, and thus hidden from scrapers
  - APIs are the only good option in this case
  - website has to create it and expose it to the public
